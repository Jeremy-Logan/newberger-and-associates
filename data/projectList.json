The Braverman residence borrows from this style but softens it around the edges creating a home that is meant to be lived in and enjoyed, while maintaining the austere permanence of the genre. The man made elements contrast and compliment the natural environment, the windows allow nature in, charred cedar accents the smooth concrete warming up the living space while altogether they create a comfortable and unique home.",

It is constructed with environmentally sensitive materials and nestled into a bright forest of oak trees which add shade and relief on hot days. The standing seam copper roof compliments the California grasses and trees in hue and texture. 14 inch thick rammed earth walls also help keep the home cool, reducing the need for artificial environmental conditioning. Truly being a part of the land, rammed earth structures use primarily local materials. This means that there is less impact on the environment due to the low carbon emissions and the little waste it produces. Outside the home, visitors can take a dip in the infinity pool while watching a game of bocce being played in the garden. Or if sitting with a cocktail is more their style, the redwood and poured concrete shade trellis offers a relaxing respite from the heat.",

Situated down the hill from the vineyards that produce their grapes, the Baxter tasting room nestles private outdoor tasting spaces into the warm, dry Mediterranean style garden. Olive trees cast dappled shade over the tables while swaying grasses sing delicately in the breeze creating a relaxing and inspiring atmosphere. The unique one of a kind redwood sunshade adds texture and comfort to this already lovely space. The site originally housed the old Philo Post Office. While considering the conversion to the tasting room, it was important to all involved to protect and respect the historic integrity of the original site, keeping the original structure and footprint intact. The entirety of the site was extensively renovated and landscaped. Copper lanterns lead visitors past the soft plaster planters and through to the custom tasting bar. Inside, the exposed Douglas Fir ceiling beams and ceramic tile plank floor add to the Mediterranean style established in the garden.",
