								Todd is principal architect, landscape designer,
								project manager and spearfisherman. Receiving
								his Bachelorâ€™s degree from University of
								California at Berkeley, he became a licensed
								architect in 2007 after spending many years in
								the industry. His visionary perspective has
								earned him opportunities to design projects with
								wide ranging functions. From modern ocean view
								homes to intimate cottages, from artfully
								designed tasting rooms to large-scale medical
								facilities: all of Todd's projects are as
								beautiful as they are functional. <br /> <br />
								He escapes it all by retreating to his vegetable
								garden by the sea, puttering and planning.
								Todd's love of the outdoors also calls him to
								the ocean. Here he can be found freediving in
								the cold Pacific waters, usually to catch his
								dinner.
								<br /> <br /> Todd's deep passion for
								architecture joins with his love of nature to
								create wonderful, livable places and spaces for
								every project he tackles. <br />
								<br /> Todd is accredited by the California
								Architects Board and holds a California
								Landscape Contractors License. His previous
								experience as a Certified Energy Analyst and a
								Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
								(LEED) Accredited Professional serve as a
								foundation for his sustainable ethic. Todd honed
								his project management skills working on complex
								healthcare facilities and applies his expertise,
								organization and rigor to your projects.
