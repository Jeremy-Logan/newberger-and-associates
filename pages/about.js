								Todd is principal architect, landscape designer,
								project manager and spearfisherman. He received
								his Bachelorâ€™s degree from University of
								California at Berkeley and became a licensed
								architect in 2007 after spending sixteen years
								working in the industry. His visionary
								perspective earned him opportunities to design
								projects with wide ranging functions. From
								modern ocean view homes to intimate cottages,
								from artfully designed tasting rooms to
								large-scale medical facilities: all of Todd's
								projects are as beautiful as they are
								functional.
								<br /> <br /> He enjoys spending long hours in
								his vegetable garden by the sea, puttering and
								planning. Todd's love of the outdoors also calls
								him to the ocean where he can be found
								freediving in the cold Pacific waters, usually
								to catch his dinner. Todd's deep passion for
								architecture joins with his love of nature,
								compelling him to create wonderful, livable
								places and spaces. <br />
								<br /> Todd is accredited by the California
								Architects Board and holds a California
								Landscape Contractors License. His previous
								experience as a Certified Energy Analyst and a
								Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
								(LEED) Accredited Professional serve as a
								foundation for his sustainable ethic. Todd has
								managed many large complex projects and applies
								his expertise, organization and rigor to every
								project.
