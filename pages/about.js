									Todd is principal architect, landscape
									designer, project manager and
									spearfisherman. Receiving his Bachelorâ€™s
									degree from University of California at
									Berkeley, he became a licensed architect in
									2007 after spending many years in the
									industry. His visionary perspective has
									earned him opportunities to design projects
									with wide ranging functions. From modern
									ocean view homes to intimate cottages, from
									artfully designed tasting rooms to
									large-scale medical facilities: all of
									Todd's projects are as beautiful as they are
									functional. <br /> <br />
									He escapes it all by retreating to his
									vegetable garden by the sea, puttering and
									planning. Todd's love of the outdoors also
									calls him to the ocean. Here he can be found
									freediving in the cold Pacific waters,
									usually to catch his dinner.
									<br /> <br /> Todd's deep passion for
									architecture joins with his love of nature
									to create wonderful, livable places and
									spaces for every project he tackles. <br />
									<br /> Todd is accredited by the California
									Architects Board and holds a California
									Landscape Contractors License. His previous
									experience as a Certified Energy Analyst and
									a Leadership in Energy and Environmental
									Design Accredited Professional serve as a
									foundation for his sustainable ethic. His
									work has been featured on Home and Garden
									Television (HGTV) and he has designed large
									complex medical complexes for organizations
									including UC Davis, Sutter Health and Kaiser
									Permanente.
